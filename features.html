				Make Every Design Different

Chopstick gives you the possibility to use <strong>either a fixed or fluid lay-out</strong>. You can easily configure the number of colums  and gutter widths, and make your page lay-out perfect on every device.

<div class="example"><pre><code class="language-css">.blog-detail {
@include box-(12, 1, 1);
// Span 12 columns
}

@media (min-width: $bp1) {
.blog-detail {
	@include box-(6, 1, 1);
	// Span 6 columns
}
}

				Typography with Meaning
			</h2>
			<p>
				The era of digital typography has finally arrived. Almost every typeface is at our disposal for use on screen. But with great power comes great responsibility.
			</p>
			<p>
				Text contains hierarchy. And you want to <strong>create hierarchy in a hassle-free and meaningful way</strong>. Including the latest font is not enough. You want to find a way to incorperate the golden ratio in your headers and paragraph text. Chopstick gets you going with a little help from our friend <strong>modular scale</strong>.
			</p>
<div class="example"><pre><code class="language-css">.title {
	font-size: ms(3);
	// Up 3 steps in modular scale
}
</code></pre></div>

				Alzheimer-proof Boilerplate
			</h2>
			<p>
				Some things are required in every site you make. It can be a pain to remember what meta-tags, conditional comments or favicon files you need. Chopstick is delivered with some <strong>nice boilerplate files to kick-start your project.</strong> Like Alzeheimer&rsquo;s medicine.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can not, however, help your grandmother make tea. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/getchopstick/chopstick-boilerplate/issues">file an issue though</a>.

				// Only Include What You Need
			</h2>
			<p>
				Remember we promised you zero kilobyte? All of these features are completely optional. <strong>If you do not need it, it will not be in your code.</strong> You have the freedom to use and abuse the framework to your benefit. You can use our complete wardrobe or choose to get completely naked!
